 * R1 scope: the plugin delegates all state to Moodle core backup and
 * restore — it does not store any data of its own — so a null_provider
 * is the honest declaration. When the wizard starts remembering user
 * preferences (default category, "always skip participants"), this
 * file must be replaced with a real metadata provider BEFORE the
 * preferences code ships.
